# Registration-Form
It's a simple registration form program in which you can register yourself using your personal details.

## Features :
1. New Registration
2. View all accounts
3. Search account
4. Update account details
5. Delete account

## How to use :
1. Copy the C++ code for main.cppp in the repository in any IDE (I use code blocks).
2. In the code create a (.txt) file named total.
3. In created .txt file write a zero (0) and save it.
4. Run the program in your IDE and start with New Registration (other features are of no use since there is no record)
5. After registering once you can check other features as well.
